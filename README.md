# Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics
This project analyzes international debt statistics collected by The World Bank, focusing on developing countries' external debt across various categories and indicators. Using SQL queries on the international_debt table containing country names, country codes, debt indicators, and debt values in USD, the analysis addresses three critical questions: identifying the number of distinct countries in the database, determining which country carries the highest debt burden, and finding which country has the lowest amount of debt repayments. This data-driven exploration provides insights into global economic patterns and the financial obligations of developing nations, offering valuable perspectives for understanding international economic relationships and debt management strategies.
